# AWS-ORG-CREATE-ROLE

This is a simple utility script that I have been using on and off in order to manage roles that need
to exist in all accounts of an organization. You do need to have one role in all accounts first that you can
assume in order to make it work.

Also, this is built based on my needs, there are things that I want to add and make it more flexible, but that is not a
priority right now. Therefore, it may or may not meet your needs.

Feel free to create issues for bugs that you find, or for any features you would like added, however, I make know promises
as to when or even if, they will be fixed/implemented.
